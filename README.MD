# Happy Cube Puzzle

Happy Cube Puzzle Task

Create a computer program that solves the given cubes puzzles and
prints the solution(s) in ASCII format into a file in unfolded format
as given below as an example.

 - Develop the solution yourself. Do not try to find a shortcut by
   using the web.
 - Develop the solution in Java using maven as build tool.

 - The core of the solution should be written without any add-ons to
   the core of the programming language. Use only the defined language
   standard (e.g. you can use all features that you find in a standard Sun JDK).
   This means that you can use external libraries, but your program
   should still produce the wanted solutions after removing those
   parts. For example, if you would decide to use a logging library
   then your program would still work correctly after removing all
   parts that use the logging library. You can also use JUnit.
 - Optimize for speed of development and quality of development. Do
   not optimize for runtime execution speed. The problem is small and
   you can afford to waste a few milli seconds. It is better to focus
   on getting a working solution faster.
 - Deliver your result in the best professional quality you can
   produce. Polish your solution. Make a master piece out of it.  It
   is part of this task to compare what different people consider to
   be a professional quality solution.
 - You do not need to create a "reader" for the input pieces. Just
   encode the input pieces directly into your program in your
   programming language of choice.

Have a look at the following link for some background information:

Here is an example:
The pieces of the blue cube look as follows:
```
  o  o o o  o  
 ooo ooooo oooo
ooooo ooo oooo 
 ooo ooooo oooo
  o  o o o  o  
 o o  o o  o o 
oooo ooooo oooo
 oooo ooo oooo 
oooo ooooo oooo
oo o o o  oo oo
```

One of the solutions in "unfolded form" looks as follows:
```
  o    o o o o 
 ooo ooooo ooo 
ooooo ooo ooooo
 ooo ooooo ooo 
  o   o oo  o  
     o o       
     ooooo     
      ooo      
     ooooo     
      o o      
     o o o     
     ooooo     
      ooo      
     ooooo     
     o o o     
      o o      
     oooo      
      oooo     
     oooo      
     oo o      
```
